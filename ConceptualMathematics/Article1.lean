Until the introduction of the definition of _category_ at the end of Article I, we implement all _maps_ in the book as Lean _functions_.

:::question (questionTitle := "Exercise 1") (questionPage := "19")
Check to be sure you understand how we got diagrams (ii) and (iii) from the given diagram (i). Then fill in (iv) and (v) yourself, starting over from (i). Then check to see that (v) and (iii) are the same.

:::solution (solutionTo := "Exercise 1")
```savedComment
Exercise I.1 (p. 19)
```

For simplicity, we use types here instead of sets. We number the elements in each set/type from top to bottom (top left to bottom right for $`D`).

```savedLean -show
namespace ExI_1
```

```savedLean
inductive A
  | a₁ | a₂ | a₃

inductive B
  | b₁ | b₂ | b₃ | b₄

inductive C
  | c₁ | c₂ | c₃ | c₄ | c₅

inductive D
  | d₁ | d₂ | d₃ | d₄ | d₅ | d₆

def f : A → B
  | A.a₁ => B.b₁
  | A.a₂ => B.b₂
  | A.a₃ => B.b₃

def g : B → C
  | B.b₁ => C.c₂
  | B.b₂ => C.c₂
  | B.b₃ => C.c₄
  | B.b₄ => C.c₅

def h : C → D
  | C.c₁ => D.d₁
  | C.c₂ => D.d₁
  | C.c₃ => D.d₃
  | C.c₄ => D.d₃
  | C.c₅ => D.d₅
```

For diagram (iv), we have $`f` as above and $`{h \circ g}` as follows:

```savedLean
def hg : B → D
  | B.b₁ => D.d₁
  | B.b₂ => D.d₁
  | B.b₃ => D.d₃
  | B.b₄ => D.d₅

example : hg = h ∘ g := by
  funext x
  cases x <;> dsimp [g, h, hg]
```

For diagram (v), we have $`{(h \circ g) \circ f}` as follows, which is indeed the same as $`{h \circ (g \circ f)}` in diagram (iii):

```savedLean
def hgf : A → D
  | A.a₁ => D.d₁
  | A.a₂ => D.d₁
  | A.a₃ => D.d₃

example : hgf = (h ∘ g) ∘ f := by
  funext x
  cases x <;> dsimp [f, g, h, hgf]
```

```savedLean -show
end ExI_1

:::excerpt (excerptPage := "19")
One very useful sort of set is a 'singleton' set, a set with exactly one element.... Call this set '$`\mathbf{1}`'.
:::

We define $`\mathbf{1}` in Lean as the finite set containing the single element of type `Unit`.

```savedComment
CM_Finset.One
```

```savedLean
namespace CM_Finset

def One : Finset Unit := Finset.univ

end CM_Finset
```

:::definition (definitionTerm := "Point") (definitionPage := "19")
A _point_ of a set $`X` is a map $`{\mathbf{1} \rightarrow X}`.
:::

We define `Point` in Lean as a `Map` between `Finset`s. (The coercion allows a term inhabiting `Map` to be used directly as a function, so we can write `f`, `John`, and `eggs` below rather than `f.toFun`, `John.toFun`, and `eggs.toFun`.)

```savedComment

```

```savedLean
namespace CM_Finset

structure Map {α β : Type*} (X : Finset α) (Y : Finset β) where
  toFun : α → β
  maps_to_codomain : ∀ a : α, a ∈ X → toFun a ∈ Y

instance {α β : Type*} (X : Finset α) (Y : Finset β)
    : CoeFun (Map X Y) (fun _ ↦ α → β) where
  coe F := F.toFun

abbrev Point {β : Type*} (Y : Finset β) := Map One Y

end CM_Finset
```

:::excerpt (excerptPage := "19")
Since a point is a map, we can compose it with another map, and get a point again.

We lift our definition for the _function_ `Point` between types to the _morphism_ `Point` in the category `Type` for later use. Note the application of `⟶` (`\hom`) for the morphism type instead of `→` (`\r`) for the function arrow.

For Exercises 2–5 which follow, rather than providing exhaustive lists of maps, it seems more useful at this stage to introduce what the book calls _Alysia's formula_, even though that formula doesn't appear until slightly later (on pp. 33–34). The formula states that the number of different maps between two finite sets is equal to the number of elements in the codomain raised to the power of the number of elements in the domain — that is, the number of maps is $`{(\#\beta)^{(\#\alpha)}}`, where $`{\#\alpha}` is the size of the domain $`\alpha` and $`{\#\beta}` is the size of the codomain $`\beta`.

Exercises 6 and 7 concern idempotence, which the book formally introduces later on p. 54. For the purpose of these two exercises (and again aiming to avoid exhaustive lists of maps), we introduce the formula
$$`\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} k^{n-k}`
for the total number of possible idempotents on a finite set. (See the Wikipedia article on [idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Idempotent_functions) for additional information.)

:::solution (solutionTo := "Exercise 8")
```savedComment
Exercise I.8 (p. 20)

No such pair exists, since the image of $`1_A` has 3 elements, but the image of $`{g \circ f}` has only 2 elements.

We will begin using the Lean notation `𝟙 X`, for the identity morphism on $`X`, after we finish Article I and start working with morphisms and categories; for now, though, since we are still operating with functions and sets, we must define the identity map on $`A` explicitly.

```savedLean

  toFun := id

    intro _ ha

We define the identity map on $`B` explicitly (see the earlier comment under Exercise 8).

A proof that $`{k ∘ h = 1_B}` holds for our pair $`h`, $`k` is given below. (We define a macro for a repeated sequence of tactics to keep the proof concise.)

```savedLean

macro_rules
  | `(tactic| eval_map $fn_name) =>
    `(tactic| (

        split
        · contradiction
        · rfl
      )
    )

example : k ∘ h = idB := by
  funext x
  rw [Function.comp_apply]
  by_cases h_x_eggs : x = "eggs"
  · rw [h_x_eggs]
    have h_eval : h "eggs" = "John" := rfl
    have k_eval : k "John" = "eggs" := rfl
    have idB_eval : idB "eggs" = "eggs" := rfl
    rw [h_eval, k_eval, idB_eval]
  · have h_eval : h x = "Mary" := by eval_map h
    have k_eval : k "Mary" = "coffee" := by eval_map k
    have idB_eval : idB x = "coffee" := by eval_map idB
    rw [h_eval, k_eval, idB_eval]
```

```savedLean -show
end ExI_9
```

There are 12 such pairs: $`h(\mathit{eggs})` can take any one of three distinct values in $`A`, leaving $`h(\mathit{coffee})` to take one of the two remaining values, which together gives $`{3 \times 2 = 6}` combinations; and for each combination, $`k` can map the element in $`A` that is not in the image of $`h` to either $`\mathit{eggs}` or $`\mathit{coffee}`.

\(3\) For each map $`f`, one object as DOMAIN of $`f` and one object as CODOMAIN of $`f`

\(4\) For each object $`A` an IDENTITY MAP, which has domain $`A` and codomain $`A`

\(5\) For each pair of maps $`{A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C}`, a COMPOSITE MAP map $`{A \xrightarrow{g \;\mathrm{following}\; f} C}`
