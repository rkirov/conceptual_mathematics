This _Companion_, which shamelessly steals its title from Terence Tao's [formalisation](https://github.com/teorth/analysis) of his [_Analysis I_](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/) textbook, is intended to be used alongside the second edition of Lawvere and Schanuel's [_Conceptual Mathematics_](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/universitypress/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/conceptual-mathematics-first-introduction-categories-2nd-edition?format=PB&isbn=9780521719162). The _Companion_ aims to formalise most of the definitions, theorems, and exercises in _Conceptual Mathematics_ using Lean 4 and mathlib, but reproduces almost none of the text from the book itself and consequently has little value on its own.

When formalising the definitions in the book, I have tried to use the corresponding definitions in mathlib where I was able to find them, rather than reinventing too many wheels. For the exercises, I have generally stayed faithful to the wording in the book, but I have taken some small liberties where I felt doing so would allow a solution to reflect more clearly the core concerns of the question (for instance, by a frequent use of types instead of sets). I have flagged any such deviations in the comments.

I have attempted to strike a balance throughout between ease of reading and optimised, idiomatic Lean code, but wherever needed have erred (I hope!) on the side of readability. In particular, I have largely avoided the use of the `simp` tactic and other automation, in order to make the logical steps in the proofs as explicit as possible.

This _Companion_ is the result of a project I undertook to learn both Lean and some elementary category theory at the same time (and ultimately a decent amount about Verso too). It remains a work in progress. It will contain plenty of opportunities for improvement and more than a few errors! I welcome any comments, suggestions, corrections, or contributions. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidkinkead/conceptual_mathematics).

To learn more about Lean and mathlib, please visit the wonderful [Lean community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).

Of particular relevance to this _Companion_ is the high-level overview of [category theory in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/theories/category_theory.html) hosted on the community site, which provides a helpful jumping-off point and also covers some of the key notation.

Regarding notation, it is worth mentioning that composition of morphisms in mathlib uses the notation `≫` (`\gg`), as in `f ≫ g`, which means "$`f` _followed by_ $`g`". To align with the book and to follow the usual convention, however, we introduce the notation `⊚` (`\oo`), as in `f ⊚ g`, which means "$`f` _following_ $`g`":

```lean
local notation:80 g " ⊚ " f:80 => CategoryStruct.comp f g
```

(This approach is suggested on the high-level overview page mentioned in the previous paragraph as well as elsewhere in the mathlib documentation.)
